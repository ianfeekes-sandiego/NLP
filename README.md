# Natural Language Processing (NLP)
This repository contains all the programming work done by Ian Feekes (ianfeekes@gmail.com) for the University of San Diego MS. Applied Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning program's Natural Language Processing course.

## Assignment 2 - NLP Basics
The second assignment involved NLP basics. It involved using spacy to perform token matching, stemming, and lemmatization.

* The first involved using the MNIST fashion clothing dataset and performing multi-classification for each image. This is done through the neural networks' output layer of 10 output neurons, each representing a class that an image most closely represents, activated through softmax activation since this is a problem of categorical classification. It has an input layer of images converted to 28x28 fed into a hidden layer of 128 neurons operating on rectified linear unit activation funtions.
* The second part involved examining different approaches taken for EDA and data preparation for images being fed into deep learning models using openCV

## Assignment 3 - Vectorization
This assignment involved token vectorization and performing vector arithmetic by writing a custom cosine similarity function

## Assignment 4 - Topic Modeling
This assignment involved TF-IDF vectorization on npr documents and using non-negative factorization to create topics and tokens associated with each topic.

## Assignment 5 - Parts of Speech
Here I performed some exploration of the peterrabbit.txt document to do some basic tagging on tokens. It then lists frequencies of Parts of Speech (POS) tags throughout the document. It illustrates a dependancy parse tree and exemplifies visualization of named entities.

## Assignment 7 - Final Project
Explores a repository of text entries from 3 different authors, running N-Grams for each author. Fits Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to create topics for training data.
